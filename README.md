# FHIR2Dataset

Transform FHIR to dataset for ML applications

This repo is a POC allowing to make a query (close to SQL format) on a FHIR API and to retrieve tabular data.

## Installation

This project is still under development, instructions are coming soon.

## Examples

Check out examples of queries and how they are transformed in call to the FHIR api!

- [Select the gender and name for patients born after 2000](examples/example1.md)
- [Get the pressure measures of patients born after 1970, together with their gender and birthdate](examples/example2.md)
- [Get the number of patients currently in intensive care unit because of Coronavirus](examples/example3.md)
- [Get clinical information about patients that were in intensive care unit because of Coronavirus](examples/example4.md)
